# Turtleboi Homelab

This is my personal Homelab stack. You're free to copy anything you want, I mostly maintain this repo for myself - As a
knowledge management system and as a way to access this data even if should I loose all access to all my data (including
login credentials).

### Backup

At the heart of any good homelab is a robust backup system in case anything goes wrong and setting up a new service ends
with corrupted data or broken hardware.

I don't keep my backups public for obvious reasons, but the [documentation](backup/README.md) is.
